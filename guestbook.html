                                I met Courtney for the first time at a Teen Weekend at Camp with Ooch. I didn’t know anyone and was quite shy, but when I arrived she was one of the first people I was introduced to. I’m sure the counselor who brought me over to her knew she would be extremely welcoming. Courtney stopped what she was doing and had no problem striking up a conversation with me and welcoming me right into this group of new people and chatting. Since then I always felt very comfortable hanging out with Courtney. </p>
                                <p>Courtney was so welcoming, sweet and kind. I cannot say I had many opportunities to spend time with her, but when I did she made them feel special. She had a joy that spread to others around her and could make anyone feel welcome and comfortable. I feel privileged to have attended Courtney’s Remission Party in 2012, again being welcomed into her group of family and friends. </p>
                                <p>In the Ooch community I know the impact Courtney had on those she met. Especially since her passing, the love for her I have seen expressed is amazing. She is someone I certainly would have liked to get to know more. She was an incredible woman. </p>
                                <p>Please know you and Courtney are in my thoughts. </p>
                                <p>A friend from Ooch, </p>

                                <p>Courtney and I started teaching at Ecole Good Shepherd Shepherd School this year and quickly became friends. Where we both moved away from home to work in Okotoks, we often would talk about family and friends. She always spoke so highly of everyone, and knew she truly loved them by how her face would light up as she shared stories about them. Being new teachers, we also talked about trying to find balance in our lives. Courtney decided early on in the school year that she was going to make time for herself by staying physically active. She tried to encourage me to do the same however I only found the drive to do so after the Christmas break. When she found out, she would often stop by my classroom to ask how things were going and to encourage me to keep it up. She has taught me that it is important to find balance in my life and every time I get on that treadmill, I hear her voice in my head cheering me on. Courtney was an amazing individual, and feel so blessed to have been able to get to know her. My thoughts and prayers are with your family.</p>

                                Our deepest condolences to the family. Our thoughts and prayers have been with Courtney and her family since hearing the tragic news. </p><p>
                                We had only known Courtney since September 2013. She was an amazing teacher and full of life with so much dedication and compassion. Our daughter talked about her often, and still does. The stories were always another one to amaze us at just how wonderful she was. We felt very blessed to have her as our teacher this year. We are sadly feeling the loss and missing her presence in our lives.</p><p>
                                Sending positive thoughts and many prayers to the family.

Courtney's smile lit up any room that she walked into. Having known Courtney from a young age allowed me to share many beautiful memories with her growing up. Her enthusiasm for life has, and always will be an inspiration to all of us. Courtney always lived life to the fullest, she always had a smile on her face and was always there when you needed her. We all need to start living life the way that Courtney did, she followed her dreams and always worked her best in order to complete them. I admire her beauty, her strength and her ability to always make you smile regardless of how you were feeling. The memories we shared will never be forgotten. Her zest for life will only continue to live on through those who were lucky enough to have ever met her. I feel so blessed to have had a friend like Courtney in my life. She will forever hold a place in my heart, our angel on earth is now our angel in heaven.

                                Though I only had the opportunity of meeting Courtney once, my first impression was a big and lasting one. I met her just over a year ago, though I had heard so much about her from her sister, my dear friend Ashley, who had always spoke of her with such love and admiration that I couldn't wait to finally meet her and when I did, I could tell exactly why Ashley spoke so highly of her and why they were sisters, because they are basically like twins! I met Courtney alongside Ash and their mother and was blown away by the combination of the three of them. So much love, warmth and closeness between all three of them. I had the privilege of hearing Courtney speak of her plans and dreams as a teacher and watched her face light up as she spoke of these. It was evident that she had so much passion for teaching, health and life in general. Getting to learn of her personal stories of experiences in her life has been truly inspiring and I feel grateful to have met such a powerful human being. Reading about what people have to say about Courtney and getting to see so many photos from throughout her life, it is clear how consistent she was in maintaining a positive attitude and zest for life even in some of the most difficult of times. Positivity and strength like that is truly extraordinary. I love her philosophy on life. It's a lesson to us all to try to live our lives as fully as possible every single day.</p>
                                <p>
                                My heart goes out to Courtney's family, friends and any other lucky person who had the privilege of ever meeting Courtney. </p>

                                <p>                                Thank you for sharing such bright light with the world Courtney, you will definitely be missed but your impression on the people whose lives you've touched will live on forever. </p>

                                Courtney was such an amazing woman with such a genuine soul. Her love for life and her will to make this world a better place was so inspiring that I know it will continue to live on in my heart and others forever. She truly was the light during my teaching year at OISE and she lifted my spirits and gave me hope daily. Not to mention, we had a lot of fun swapping "grandma stories" some mornings as we both lived with our grandmas during teacher's college. We came to the conclusion that our grandmothers truly enjoyed sharing their love for us with FOOD and LOTS OF IT!</p><p>

                                My condolences to the Anderson family and all of Courtney's friends and loved ones. May her inspiration live on in us each day and her soul live eternally, with God the Father. God Bless

                                What sad new to be heard through an email. I am so sorry for your loss but hope that you will find the memories of Courtney to sooth your sadness. 

                                A life is determined by two dates: That of birth and that of the ending. It is the dash in between that says the story of your daughters life and you are privilaged to know the entire store of that precious time. 

                                With great sadness,

                                I worked alongside Courtney at Mini-University for many years. Our last summer working together we were on the Leadership Team, spending countless hours together. Often Courtney would provide us with her humour; saying funny things in weird voices- that we still quote even to this day. What made our last summer working together so memorable were all the laughs, all the times that Courtney shared her honest opinion (that sometimes we didn’t want to hear), and the moments of pure happiness that were shared between us and the entire camp. </p><p>

                                Court and I also took a course together this past summer at Redeemer University (Spec Ed 1). It was amazing seeing Courtney on a regular basis again. She brought energy, laughter, and friendship to a four hour long lecture (which can be hard to do). During those classes we talked about our upcoming struggles as we embarked into our teaching careers; how finding jobs would be difficult. Sure enough she landed herself a job shortly after our conversation. I remember seeing her on the day of her interview; beaming with excitement, knowing that teaching the leaders of tomorrow was her calling. And it was. Her passion for life and ability to always see the bright side, are the qualities that the leaders of tomorrow should possess. Courtney certainly passed those characteristics onto me and I know that all those she came in contact with would say the same. </p><p>

                                I am so proud of you Courtney, you accomplished so much in your lifetime and will continue to do so through our memories of you. Thank you for being such an exceptional lady. 
                                </p><p>
                                I miss you, love you and will always be thinking about you,<br/>

I met Courtney last year at OISE and I am truly blessed to call her a friend. She truly lived life to the fullest! Any challenge that came her way she went for it! She is such a inspiration! We were always joking around and having silly sayings such as "ain't no buddy got time for that". She had such a beautiful soul. She was one of a kind. I will miss her (and our shenanigans) but I will always remember her. I will carry her memory in my heart.
                                </p>

                                Ashley, when I heard the news of this accident it took my breath away. I remember you speaking so fondly of your sister, and of joining her in the Ride a couple of years ago, even though you were not feeling so great yourself. I was so inspired by you and your devotion to your sister.<br/>
                                My heart goes out to you and your entire family.<br/>
                                Please know that all of us at CCFC are thinking of you, and are always there for you.<br/>
                                With very much love and sadness,<br/>
                                Maria

Heart-breaking. Absolutely heart-breaking. Lord, help us to accept the things we cannot change and to remember all the smiles, laughter, and memories we have. She was a truly beautiful person inside and out. We will always love and miss you.

                                Dear Lonny and Karen,
                                <br/><br/>
                                We are sad to hear of your daughter's passing. During these difficult times, true comfort comes from remembering the words found in the Bible book of Isaiah chapter 25 verse 8, which reads, "He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces". With deep sympathy, we share your sorrow. May the resurrection hope sustain you.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Sincerely,<br/>
                                Pam and Ashley
                                </p>

                                I was shocked when I was told about Courtney's death. I wish that I had gotten more opportunities to get to know her and become greater friends. I first met Courtney back in 2007 I think it was, when she & I were on the bus heading up to Camp Oochigeas. She was one of first people that I met on the bus that year. We kept in touch here & there over the years. Two years ago, when she was celebrating 5 years of being Cancer Free, she invited me to her house for a party and she was so happy to see me and her family and friends were really nice. Everyone at the party really liked me and it was one of the best fun nights of my life. The year I met Courtney, I'd liked her alot that I made her a bracelet and I think she even wore it on the day of her party. I gave her a mug that really marked the occasion perfectly. I hope she got the chance to use it for her morning cups of coffee/tea. I told her how I wanted to become an actor and that I was trying to find ways to go to school for that, and she said "That's Fun! Follow Your Dream, Ray . . . I'll be your #1 Fan!" I wish she was still here with us. She was so young. 
                                <br/><br/>
                                I miss you, Courtney!!!!

I first met Courtney at camp ooch. She was one of the friendliest people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I don't even remember how it happened but we quickly became friends. Every time I would go back to camp for weekend retreats she was always one of the first people to say hi and give me a hug. She was one of those people that was always smiling. The amazing thing about Courtney is that she was one of those people who, even if you lost touch for a while when you saw her again it was like nothing changed. I still remember the last time I saw her. It was during a Y.A retreat and we were about to play a group game called tank. I didnt want to play but Courtney convinced me to. She even volunteered to be my partner. I was never one for group games but having her as my partner made me change my mind.We didnt win but we were a force to be reckoned with. I'll never forget her and I'm sure those who knew her won't forget either. May her soul rest in peace. Its never really goodbye. Its just see you later.
                                </p>

I've known Courtney since junior kindergarden as we both were classmates all through elementary school. She was one of the nicest persons I've ever known, truly an example of how everyone should live their life. I didn't realize she had won her battle with cancer and volunteered to help children in Kenya, yet I wouldn't expect any less of her. The world won't be the same without her. My deepest sympathies go out to her friends and family.

                            I was blessed to meet Courtney through the Catholic church (Canadian Martyrs) she attended while she was at McMaster University. She always had a smile on her face and a something positive and sweet to say. She was so very kind and thoughtful and I really enjoyed chatting with her and talking about our mutual interest in sports, running in particular. She will never be forgotten and I pray that she may be at rest with God in her eternal home now. My prayers and heartfelt condolences go out to all her family. Courtney set such an example as a genuine caring, loving Christian and her influence and example will never be forgotten. God Bless,

                                Our thoughts and love are with the Anderson Family! We love and grieve Courtney like our own and yet we never met her! Through the eyes of our daughter Sophie Brisbois we appreciated her wit, intelligence, strong will and strength. 

                            <br/><br/>
                                She made an impact on her little third graders, colleagues, and everyone that came into contact with her. She loved and gave unconditionally and will continue to be an inspiration and role model to young girls in Kenya and young women around the world.

                            <br/><br/>
                                We are very saddened with the loss of your beautiful child and angel. 

                            <br/><br/>
                                Faith has brought Sophie and Courtney together. It is through faith that you will pull through this tragedy!

                            <br/><br/>

                                Dear Mr. and Mrs. Anderson, please know that my thoughts and prayers are with your family during this difficult time. I got to know Courtney a little over the months she worked at EGSS. No matter what was happening she was always wearing a bright smile. She will be missed by those who knew her for such a short time. 

                            <br/><br/>
                                "The life and death of each of us has it's influence on others; if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord, so that living or dead we belong to the Lord. ". Romans 14:7-9 
                            <br/><br/>
                                It is my belief that Courtney is fulfilling this scripture. May you feel the loving arms of God around you, and find comfort that Courtney is seeing Jesus face to face. 
                            <br/><br/>

                                Although I have only known Courtney a short time, meeting her this past year at OISE, I quickly saw how she is one of those rare people where just by looking at her and her smile, you could see her spirit shinning. Everyone could see that she had a zest for life and that she lived her days fully. Knowing that she fought for her dreams and the chance to have amazing memories like going to Kenya, has taught me that I should not be afraid to chase my dreams and live life to the fullest.

                                My deepest condolences go out to the Anderson family, loved ones and   friends.

                            With her smile - the breath of life, and the kindness that warms the soul,<br/>
                                her lively spirit will forever be cherished and not to be forgotten.

                            WHAT MATTERS ~<br/>
                            So what will matter? How will the value of your days be measured?<br/>
                            What will matter is not what you bought but what you built,<br/>
                            not what you got but what you gave.<br/>
                            What will matter is not your success but your significance.<br/>
                            What will matter is not what you learned but what you taught.<br/>
                            What will matter is every act of integrity, compassion, courage or sacrifice that enriched,<br/>
                            empowered or encouraged others to emulate your example.<br/>
                            What will matter is not your competence but your character.<br/>
                            What will matter is not how many people you knew,<br/>
                            but how many will feel a lasting loss when you’re gone.<br/>
                            What will matter is not your memories but the memories of those who loved you.<br/>
                            What will matter is how long you will be remembered, by whom and for what.<br/>
                            Living a life that matters doesn’t happen by accident.<br/>
                            It’s not a matter of circumstance but of choice.<br/>
                            Choose to live a life that matters. ~ Michael Josephson<br/>

                            <br/><br/>
                            Your beloved Courtney truly exemplified living a life that mattered. <br/>

                                My son Hayden had the honor of being in Miss Anderson's grade 3 class this year. Upon hearing of her death, between heart breaking sobs he said "Miss Anderson didnt just make me happy, she changed my world" I believe she changed the world for everyone who encountered her lovely spirit.<br/>
                                She will forever be loved, missed and remembered by my little boy as the first teacher who believed in him and his ability.<br/>
                                She was truly a wonderful angel in the life of so many. I know the faith she instilled in Hayden will help him through this time and stay with him forever.<br/>
                                My thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and students.

                                I first met Courtney in the Hands of Hope competition and we quickly became close friends. Her love for health and fitness is what really pulled us together. We worked out together, cycled together and she motivated me to start running. She was truly inspirational and one of the few individuals that have changed my perspective on life. Courtney and I went skydiving together, ran the Mississauga Half Marathon, did the Spartan race and a few 10K races together. She always pushed me to challenge myself physically, emotionally and mentally. At one time Courtney was a volunteer Big Sister in Hamilton. After seeing the impact she had on children I quickly followed suit. The experience I have gained as a volunteer Big Brother derived from the spark that Courtney lit within me. Aside from fitness we quickly learned that we shared a love for food and music. We would randomly meet up for Sushi and on occasion she would sway me to stay in and cook a healthy meal. Diet was a big deal for Courtney, something I've learned to love and appreciate. Music was a channel where Courtney and I found emotional expression and motivation. The one song we listened to often was: <br/>
                                - All the Above - Maino 

                            <br/><br/>
                            I reference this song below as I believe it is representative of Courtney's outlook to life, its beauty and challenges:<br/>
                            "How the hell could you stop me? <br/>
                            Why in the world would you try? <br/>
                            I go hard forever, <br/>
                            That's just how I'm designed, <br/>
                            That's just how I was built <br/>
                            See the look in my eyes? <br/>
                            You take all of this from me, <br/>
                            And I'm still gon' survive "<br/><br/>

                                And survive she shall. In my heart, mind and soul. Understanding her faith in the Lord leaves me with no doubt that she is by His side. I am extremely emotional and shattered by her sudden passing and will always remember Courtney to be that happy, go-getting, motivated and loving individual. Courtney impacted my life in many ways - I am in her debt and will continue to bring my best foot forward daily, just as she did. I love you Courtney - you will be greatly missed but never forgotten. My sincerest condolences to the Anderson family. 
                                </p>

I met Courtney in person for the first time this past Thanksgiving after she had moved to Calgary to teach in Okotoks. I had met her spirit long before then through her aunties Robin and Holly and her nanna Brenda. From the moment I was in her presence I was smitten with her. I told her I wanted her to be my adopted daughter. She has such a light surrounding her. She is so beautiful and thoughtful and kind. I feel so blessed to have been able to help celebrate her 24th birthday. Thank you Lonny and Karen for the sharing the gift of Courtney. My heart breaks for your family. My prayers are with you all.
                                </p>

                                I have no words to describe how wonderful and beautiful Courtney was. She simply was an angel. I was so blessed to call her my friend. She is so, so loved, and will be missed forever. She has and will continue to inspire me, and everyone who knew her, to be better. 

                            <br/><br/>
                                We became instant and lifelong friends while at teacher's college together. We have shared so many special memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life. All of her inspiring, wise words are so clear in my mind. I already so miss our daily talks, and will exchange them with daily prayers. I will keep her amazing family, who raised the most beautiful person, in my prayers.

I was truly saddened to hear about Courtney's sudden passing. I met her at OISE last year and we spent our first practicum together at Holy Angels. She was a lovely, kind person with a bright, beautiful smile and personality. She will be missed immensely by all who had the privilege of knowing her. My prayers go out to her family and friends.

I worked with Courtney at Mini-U at McMaster University during the summer of 2012. Although we only spent a short amount of time together, she had a great influence on my life. Her positive attitude and energy inspired me to be the best I could be every day. When I split my lip open playing a game with the staff, Courtney was the one who accompanied me to the hospital. I really enjoyed having that time to get to know her. Her selflessness shone through as she truly took an interest in my life, trying to get to know me in a way that none of the other staff members had. I will always remember her spunk and zest for life and will carry her influence with me for the rest of my life.

Courtney was the first friend I made in kindergarten. We spent most of our elementary school years attached to one another. We shared lunches, had sleepovers, she even got married in my backyard when we were five. There isn't a single childhood birthday party picture I have that Courtney isn't in. She was a wonderful and sweet person. If she saw you were sad, she went out of her way to make you smile. The world has lost a beautiful creature, but God has regained one of his angels.

The many moments I spent with Courtney in summer 2010 at Mini U were some of the best I've ever had for many reasons. They would not have been the same without her amazing glowing personality, kindness, empathy, beautifully addictive smile and enthusiasm for each day. I had the privilege of knowing such a remarkable human being and I am deeply saddened by her passing . This sudden tragedy has made me reflect on what the world will be missing without the person I knew and loved and my thoughts go out to her family and all others whose lives she touched. I am thinking of her fun, spunky spirit and extreme kindness toward our fellow colleagues but foremost toward the kids, whose lives were undoubtedly touched by her impact and her role as a mentor and friend. I remember the day she humbly told me the reason she was cycling to raise money for cancer research. I was blown away by her strength and drive to make a difference and help others, especially since she had struggled herself, a past point she did not let define her present. It is a great loss to lose a person so magnificent, I hope that her light continues to shine through this difficult time.

                                I was shocked and saddened to hear about Courtney's tragic accident. My heart and prayers go out to her family - her mom, Karen and her sister Ashley, whom I knew and to her dad, Lonny and brothers Bryan & Jordan. I know how close you are as a family and trust that your strong bond will comfort you.
                            <br/><br/>

                                I have a vivid picture of Courtney as a member of my Brownie & Girl Guide units at St. Rose of Lima. At a weekend camp, I was awakened by some voices and got out of my tent to investigate. I found Courtney and my daughter, Alyssa lying on a tent platform totally enraptured with the rising sun and realizing how special it is to see the sun rise and that they were the only ones to see it happen that morning.
                            <br/><br/>

                                Whenever I see a sun rise, I will think of Courtney and what a wonderful soft spoken girl she was and what a wonderful poised and confident young woman she became.

                                I first met Courtney at OISE and it wouldn't have been the same without her. We were constantly laughing and cracking jokes throughout class and going on little adventures. I will never forget the day me, Kelly, and Jennifer went to the ROM, it was one of the funniest moments in my life! She was always there if you needed help and has accomplished and touched the lives of so many in such a short amount of time. Courtney is truly an inspiration and was an amazing classmate, teacher and friend, it is such a shame that she was taken from us so early. I have no doubt she is smiling down at us from Heaven! I will leave you with one of Courtney's favorite Bible verses as it pretty much sums up her outlook on life.

In our early teenage years me and Courtney hung out in the same social circle. Courtney amazed me by her ability to balance both an active social life, while achieving at a high level in both her academic and extracurricular fields. When I first started hanging out with Courtney, I had just transitioned out of the enhanced program at Lorne Park Secondary School and stopped pursuing post-secondary education as a future goal. Courtney while remaining friendly, was very critical of my decision and over the years advised me, while leading by example, to seek out the betterment of myself through education. After a 2 year stretch where i hadn't seen Courtney at all, we reconnected at a friends birthday party. She at the time was attending McMaster and I was getting into trouble, she asked me so earnestly what University I was attending. She assumed the best of me, even though we had lost touch she honestly believed I had found academic success. I remember how bad I felt when she had such an honest look of surprise when I told her I had dropped out of high school. We stayed in touch through social media and the occasional text message as I reentered highschool, and eventually achieved both acceptance and a scholarship to The University of Guelph. Courtney's faith in my abilities was one of the primary driving forces behind my reinvigorated pursuit of a better life. She was an inspiration and her example changed my life, I am deeply saddened that I never got to tell her that.

Working with Lonny over the past 7 years, I have heard many funny and heartwarming stories of his family. I have followed Courtney's triumph over cancer, her time spent as a camp counsellor and her move to Calgary to pursue her teaching career. She was so loved, and lived her life to the fullest. My heartfelt condolences to you all. May the wonderful and happy memories of time spent with Courtney help to ease your pain and loss.

When you are trying to put words together, they never sound as good as you would like them too or completely do what you are trying to say justice. How can you say anything bad about Courtney...Courtney was such an inspiration to be around and I first met her at Mini U during a very hot summer. At the first group BBQ I remember thinking to myself how approachable Courtney was and how you felt like a close friend after talking with her for only a few minutes. Her warming smile and friendly ways really made her kids fall in love with her each session. One of the most memorable parts was when Courtney and a few of us attempted that Insanity DVD with Sahil, I think we only lasted a week but we would laugh through the DVD to make it hurt a little less. He would say that if we were laughing we weren't working hard enough...which of course made us laugh even more... Man, we had a great summer the group of us. It is very upsetting to hear this news about the loss Courtney and it is difficult for all for us to wrap our minds around how quickly life can be taken away from us. You will definitely be remembered and your life celebrated Courtney.

                                I met Courtney back in grade 7 (over 14 years ago). We sort of lost contact in high school but ended up bumping into each other at McMaster University a couple times. She was a good friend in elementary school and I wasn't surprised to find that she was still the same amazing person when we met up again in university. 

                            <br/><br/>
                                As it turns out, there were several more amazing things about her I didn't know. I just found out through reading her obituary that she also beat leukemia, was an avid cyclist, and volunteered in Kenya and I'm sure there was much more.
                            <br/><br/>

                                My deepest sympathies go out to her family and friends. Courtney was an inspirational person and she will be sorely missed.

I am so heart sick to hear of this terrible news. I am lost for words. I remember sweet Courtney when she was just a little girl, who grew up to be a beautiful lady. My condolences to the family xo Lonny, Karen, Ashley, Brian and Jordan. May you all be with one another during this terrible time and know that Courtney is with every single one of you, and always will be. Xoxo

I had the honour of knowing Courtney in high school. when I met her I immediately know she wad special. She spoke and acted as if she had lived before, and had a knowledge beyond her years. She always wanted to live life to it's fullest and kept her relationships sacred. It was almost as if she was too good for this world and was called to heaven once, and proved she had a lot more good to do here on Earth, and she wasnt going to leave it behind without making a difference. She truly accomplished that. She touched a million hearts and the ripples she made in life will ebb forever.

                                For the 3 years that I worked with Courtney at Mini University, her positive attitude and bright spirit brought happiness and laughter to my camp days. No matter what the situation, Courtney always took an optimistic spin and supported others wherever she could. Working intimately alongside Courtney on the Leadership Team, provided me with the opportunity to be inspired by her zest for life and compassionate nature to everyone around her on a daily basis. It is a characteristic in which I always valued in Courtney and saw the impact which it had on others. 
                            <br/><br/>

                                Although Courtney is no longer physically with us, her energy and spirit will continue to live on and impact all of our lives moving forward. 
                            <br/><br/>

                            Loving you always and forgetting you never,<br/>

My deepest condolences to the family. I cannot even begin to imagine how you must be feeling. We were in the same program together at McMaster, worked together at the YMCA, and just now I am realizing we both went to OISE. she was always a such a pleasure to talk to. I loved chatting with her after work. I told her all about my woes and troubles and she always offered a listening ear. such a bring and peaceful presence. I hope she did not suffer. My thoughts and prayers are with the family. May she rest in peace.

                                Dear Lonny, Karen, Ashley, Bryan, and Jordan:
                            <br/><br/>

                                I am heartbroken and truly saddened to hear of Courtney's passing. I have thought of all of you, and of Courtney since I heard the news last night, and I send my deepest condolences and all of my prayers and love to you all. Courtney was a beautiful and intelligent woman, a wonderful and born teacher, and someone I am so lucky to have known and to have called my friend. I am so glad that she and I kept in touch over the years and that I was able to be there for her when she asked my advice on Calgary and for teaching. Now, I will carry her with me always and remember her beauty and her light, her positivity and her friendship; she is home safe in the arms of God, our Father, forever and for always and will guide us and protect us until we meet her again.
                            <br/><br/>

                                I will see you all on Friday and will be there on Saturday. May God bless you and keep you all, and may Courtney rest in eternal peace.
                            <br/><br/>

                                With love,
                            <br/><br/>

                                Although I only met Courtney recently at OISE, everyone could tell from the very beginning that she had a soul that could brighten up any room. During that short period of time she showed me the value of being carefree and living life to the fullest when she decided to do her internship in Kenya. She was a brave woman to accept the fact that she would be sleeping not too far from lions, as Greg Rogers described to us at the Religious Retreat. This was a truly tragic and unfortunate event that claimed the life of someone so young and full of life. While she is no longer here with us physically, her spirit will remain alive forever and we will see her again one day in our Father's house. My deepest condolences go out to all of Courtney's Family, Friends, Students, and all of the lives she has made better just with her presence. 
                            <br/><br/>

My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.

                                My sincerest condolences to Courtney's family.
                            <br/><br/>
                                I was so blessed to meet and spend time with Courtney for three weeks when we travelled to Kenya together in May, 2013. Courtney and I taught the nursery class together and she was so wonderful with the students. She was so gentile and kind. We spent a lot of time getting to know each other and though I only knew Courtney for less than a year, she was such a dear friend to me and I will miss her very much. She inspired me to be active and healthy and she was such an honest person. In her short 24 years of lives she accomplished more than the average person does their entire life. She touched so many hearts and will never be forgotten.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Thinking of you all during this hard time.<br/>

                                Dearest Anderson Family,
                            <br/><br/>
                                My prayers are with you in this time of great sorrow. I was privileged to know of Courtney 20 years ago at St. Rose of Lima. I was in grade 6, and Courtney was in kindergarten with my brother, Michael. We were paired together for "Book Buddies", where I had the pleasure to read her stories each week. Her sun-kissed short hair paired with her ocean blue eyes would touch my heart each time she smiled and curled up to listen to a new story. For 20 years, I have never forgot her angelic face, and as years passed I would always inquire from my brother how she was doing. 
                            <br/><br/>

                                I am so very and deeply sorry for your family's tragic loss. Courtney will stay in my prayers forever. My family sends our deepest condolences. May God bring you strength. Rest in eternal peace lovely angel as you are.
                            <br/><br/>

                                I was very fortunate to have met Courtney at OISE and she was one of the first person and friend I made there. Ever since then, we developed a special friendship that I will forever cherish and remember. Courtney was such a sweet, caring and understanding person and she was there for me when I was going through a tough time. She always stood by my side and she was someone I can always rely on. When Courtney and I met, my daughter was only 1 year old and my daughter never wanted anyone else to hold her besides me. When I introduced Sophia to Court, I was amazed on how fast Sophia went to her. Sophia loved Court and Courtney treated her as if she knew her since she was born. She had a wonderful spirit and you could always see it. Courtney got me into cycling and she encouraged me to do the ride last summer. I was no where near ready for it but she believed in me and supported me. She helped me train, she let me use her bike and she even rode beside me because it was my first time and she knew how much the ride meant to me. She was so proud of me and her support and encouragement was amazing.

                                Words can't express how I feel right now...I lost a very special friend and I am so heartbroken. I had a wonderful opportunity to introduce her to my family and they loved her the minute they met. 
                            <br/><br/>
                                My family and I would like to send our condolences to the Anderson family. Courtney always talked about her family and mentioned how much she loved them and missed them. You are in our thoughts and prayers. Courtney was an amazing person and Heaven has gained a wonderful Angel. Courtney is too well loved to ever be forgotten and she will always be in my heart. I will never forget your wonderful smile and personality. I love you Court xo

                                Our little Tunie, a wonderfully spiritual young women who loved God, family, and friends with a sincerity that is rarely seen. Her strength and courage was evident in that she really 'lived' her life. I am blessed to be her Godfather and to have her as part of my life, and my family's as well. Our prayers are with her parents and siblings as they endure this unexpected loss. But we believe in God and heaven and hope that she has found her way there.

                                As Courtney's grade 4 teacher, I remember that smile and joy of life which she always exhibited. As I saw her when she grew into a lovely young lady that smile was still there. She was blessed with a loving family and all of you were blessed to have Courtney in your lives. Know that she will be with you always as her smile shines on you always.
