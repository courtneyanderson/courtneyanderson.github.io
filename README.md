##About this project
Court was my friend â€“ not a day passes that I don't think of her.

She had a memorial site created by the funeral home. I haven't closed that tab
since I've opened it... but it is a service, and it expires in just over a week
at the time of this writing.

While nothing is certain, I feel like GitHub Pages at least has some permanence
for the foreseeable future which makes it a reasonable host for an alternative.

It's the least I can do to keep the spirit alive online.

:heart:
