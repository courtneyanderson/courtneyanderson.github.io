                                        <p>Hi, I’m Brendan, Courtney’s Godfather and uncle, or simply Uncle B.</p>

                                        <p>Reflecting back on what has been a very difficult week, I wanted to share with you what made Courtney really special in my life. Courtney was woman of strong faith, which was the foundation and anchor in her life. She loved God. From that is where we all saw her admirable qualities of hope, joy, and love. She was such a deeply caring person; she was always laughing and very funny. Tunie, as she is affectionately known, always tried to make you laugh whether it was the little nicknames she called everyone, or the silly notes she left. She made everyone feel so special, and made you feel like you were the most important person when you were with her. </p>

                                        <p>As many of you know, Courtney is a cancer survivor. She started treatment seven years ago and with determination, support, and perseverance she got well. After five years of being cancer free she held a wonderful celebration of life party for her friends, family, and fellow cancer survivors. Many of whom are here today. In what most of us might fear as being a dark place, she had hope in her life; the desire and will to live life to the fullest. </p>

                                        <p>St. Paul wrote that “We can rejoice in our sufferings, for they help us develop endurance. And that endurance develops strength of character. And strength of character produces hope.” One of the greatest qualities we can have is hope – “a strong and confident expectation for the future.” Courtney had this hope more than anyone I know. The struggles she had in her life made her the person she became, and who we love. </p>

                                        <p>When Courtney fought her battle with cancer she told me she found a certain peace and joy deep within herself, realizing that her life was not her own, a peace that comes with knowing we belong to God. During her treatment, I remember asking her if she was afraid of what she was going through. She told me no, not for herself, but for her parents and family, and what it would mean for them. </p>

                                        <p>From there, she blossomed. Forever with that beautiful smile on her face, she took up running, she ran marathons, rode her bike hundreds of kilometers with the Ride to Conquer Cancer, went skydiving, she travelled to Kenya to help build a school, graduated teachers college, and became a full time teacher in Okotoks, Alberta. She really lived life to the fullest. She had this joy in her life that was apparent in everything she did. The joyfulness that she shared with us inspires us in our own lives. Her joy and laughter was contagious. </p>

                                        <p>We’re familiar with Jesus’ great commandment - “Love your neighbor as you love yourself”. While a simple precept, we know how difficult it is to live like this in our everyday lives. But Courtney excelled at this, she had a genuine love of Christ in her heart for other people. We saw Him in her. A reminder of this for me is at Christmas. We have a large gathering where our whole family is together. So it’s an exciting time with people bringing gifts, food; or just themselves. And, while it is good to see everyone as they come in, Courtney was the one you couldn't wait to hug. That simply describes her. You could see the love she had for you when she came through the door. And you wanted to be part of it. And we are. </p>

                                        <p>All of us live in community where we have an effect on everyone around us, both good and not so good. What I know from Courtney is how wonderful life can be when others see that hope, joy, and love in us, as we did in her. She was a great witness of the joy of Christ. Although Courtney was here on earth for what seems like too short of a time, just look at the effect she has had on all of us. Her funeral home visitation yesterday was the largest they ever had. People came from the States, Calgary, Australia, and beyond. This is a testament to how much we all love Courtney and how much she loves us. She had a wonderful life, a life truly lived. We are blessed to have been part of it.</p>
